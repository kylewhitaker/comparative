# COVID-19 Data Visualization

### Product Requirements:

- Languages: React, Typescript, NodeJS
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Backend: Rest API using NodeJS
- DataSets: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data
- Product Definition: The goal is to create an Interactive Covid Tracking and Comparison

### Application Functionality:

1. Users can compare Covid information between different regions, country, or city or any sub-criteria that is available in the data. e.g. Compare North American death rates for vaccinated Male Smokers compared to Europe
1. There will be a Baseline Input Section and a Comparison Input Section
1. If there is nothing in Comparison you will just show the information about baseline
1. There will be interactive graphs which are populated after the initial search: (your choice of libraries)
   E.g. Bar, line. Scatter, Bubble chart, world map
1. The charts will all be interactive where they will have mouseovers of the data and also can drill in if appropriate (be creative: for example if clicking into North America you will see the countries in there with their data)
1. Some example of useful Covid charts https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html
1. [BONUS: If you have time] Users are able to have a profile where they can store criteria data that will be pre-populated when they log in and do new searches

### Evaluation Criteria:

- Code Quality and Readability
- React and Node Best practices
- Creation of UX, Charts and visualizations
- Unit test coverage
